## Explanation of `app.config.ts`

The `app.config.ts` file is used to configure providers for dependency injection in the Angular application. In this file, we define the providers array, which includes various Angular and Firebase providers.

### Providers Explanation:

- `provideRouter(routes)`: Registers the application routes defined in `app.routes.ts` for routing purposes.

- `provideClientHydration()`: Provides client-side hydration support. This is typically used in Angular Universal applications.

- `importProvidersFrom(...)`: Imports Firebase providers for Firestore and Storage. 

  - `provideFirebaseApp(() => initializeApp(firebaseConfig))`: Initializes the Firebase application using the configuration provided in `firebaseConfig`.

  - `provideFirestore(() => getFirestore())`: Provides Firestore functionality to the application.

  - `provideStorage(() => getStorage())`: Provides Firebase Storage functionality to the application.

### Usage:

1. Ensure that the Firebase configuration is correctly set up in `firebase.config.ts` and imported into `app.config.ts`.

2. Add any additional providers or configuration as needed for your application.

3. Import `appConfig` from `app.config.ts` into your Angular application's modules, and provide it in the `providers` array.

```typescript
import { appConfig } from './app.config';

@NgModule({
  ...
  providers: [appConfig.providers],
  ...
})
export class AppModule { }
```

By configuring providers in `app.config.ts`, we can easily manage and organize dependencies for our Angular application, including Firebase services.
